The starter motor\nrequires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that’s why the wire\ngoing to it is so large.\n  Feeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas\nelectronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is\nBritish, and all things British leak!  British convertible tops leak water,\nBritish engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and\nI might add British tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks\nsecrets... so naturally British electronics leak smoke.", "author":"Jack Banton, PCC Automotive Electrical School"},

Well we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 31.\nWe were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally arrived in\nAfrica.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at\n6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by\n6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That\nwas the biggest game we had.  Africa is primarily inhabited by Elks, Moose\nand Knights of Pithiests.\n  The elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their\nannual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,\nwhich they leave immediately when they discover it’s full of water.  They\nweren’t looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.\n  One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my\npajamas, I don’t know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That’s a tough\nword to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were\nimbedded so firmly we couldn’t get them out.

The best way\nto avoid broken circuits is to change your fuses regularly.\n  Another common problem is that the lights flicker.  This sometimes\nmeans that your electrical system is inadequate, but more often it means\nthat your home is possessed by demons, in which case you’ll need to get a\ncaulking gun and some caulking.  If you’re not sure whether your house is\npossessed, see “The Amityville Horror”, a fine documentary film based on an\nactual book.  Or call in a licensed electrician, who is trained to spot the\nsigns of demonic possession, such as blood coming down the stairs, enormous\ncats on the dinette table, etc.", "author":"Dave Barry, “The Taming of the Screw”"},

{"quote":"  Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind; it is a temper of\nthe will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a predominance\nof courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over love of ease.\n  Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years; people grow\nold only by deserting their ideals.

{"quote":"... Now you’re ready for the actual shopping.  Your goal should be to\nget it over with as quickly as possible, because the longer you stay in\nthe mall, the longer your children will have to listen to holiday songs\non the mall public-address system, and many of these songs can damage\nchildren emotionally.  For example: “Frosty the Snowman” is about a\nsnowman who befriends some children, plays with them until they learn\nto love him, then melts.  And “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” is about\na young reindeer who, because of a physical deformity, is treated as an\noutcast by the other reindeer.  Then along comes good, old Santa.  Does\nhe ignore the deformity?  Does he look past Rudolph’s nose and respect\nRudolph for the sensitive reindeer he is underneath?  No.  Santa asks\nRudolph to guide his sleigh, as if Rudolph were nothing more than some\nkind of headlight with legs and a tail.  So unless you want your\nchildren exposed to this kind of insensitivity, you should shop\nquickly.", "author":"Dave Barry, “Christmas Shopping: A Survivor’s Guide”"},

{"quote":"***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)\n\nIt has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge\nin order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,\nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call\n“wisdom engineering”.  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a\nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.\nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom\nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so\nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic\nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL\nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed\nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those\nunderlying Plato’s theory of government, Kant’s metaphysics, Nietzsche’s theory\nof value, and Husserl’s phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe\nIMMANUEL’s achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly\ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration."},

Edison’s design was a brilliant\nadaptation of the simple electrical circuit: the electric company sends\nelectricity through a wire to a customer, then immediately gets the\nelectricity back through another wire, then (this is the brilliant\npart) sends it right back to the customer again.\n\nThis means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch\nof electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since\nvery few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely.\nIn fact the last year any new electricity was generated in the United\nStates was 1937; the electric companies have been merely re-selling it\never since, which is why they have so much free time to apply for rate\nincreases.", "author":"Dave Barry, “What is Electricity?”"},

For example, our ethernet front ends need to know\nwhat network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs\nproperly.  How do you find out what your network number is?  Easy, you ask a\ngateway.  Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network\nnumbers.  Once you’ve got your network number, you start using it and before\nyou can blink you’ve got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all\nover creation.  Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he\nwas running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong\nnetwork number?  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  Supposing that your\nsoftware discovers that the gateway is now giving out a different network\nnumber than before, what’s it supposed to do about it?  This is not discussed\nin the protocol document.  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  I think you\nget my drift."},

Pull one of these\n  horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n  of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n  took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n  horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n  are all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all\n  horses are the same color.\nTheorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.\nProof (by intimidation):\n  Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It\n  is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n  back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n  horse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n  infinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n  However, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n  infinite number of legs.

The following story is told about him: when they\nmoved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\nuseless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, “Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I’m Norbert Weiner\nand we’ve just moved.  Would you know where we’ve moved to?”  To which the\nyoung girl replied, “Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.”\n  The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it wasn’t\nquite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest of it,\nhowever, was pretty close to what actually happened...", "author":"Richard Harter"},

In higher\nconcentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it\ntakes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.

The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is\nsufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any\nconsiderable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with\nsymptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.\n\nOxygen is an extreme fire hazard.

If an artist\n  is wounded, one such who goes with hurdie-gurdie or travels with\n  fiddle or drum, then the people shall take a wild heifer and bring\n  it out on the hillside.  Then they shall shave off all hair from the\n  heifer’s tail, and grease the tail.  Then the artist shall be given\n  newly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of the heifer’s tail,\n  and a man shall strike it with a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he\n  shall have the animal.

Reaching under\nhis pillow, Stalin produced two envelopes labeled #1 and #2.\n  “Take these letters,” he tells Khruschev. “Keep them safely -- don’t\nopen them.  Only if the country is in turmoil and things aren’t going well,\nopen the first one.  That’ll give you some advice on what to do.  And, if\nafter that, if things start getting REALLY bad, open the second one.”  And\nwith a gasp Stalin breathed his last.\n  Well, within a few years Khruschev started having problems --\nunemployment increased, crops failed, people became restless.  He decided it\nwas time to open the first letter.  All it said was: “Blame everything on me!”\nSo Khruschev launched a massive deStalinization campaign, and blamed Stalin\nfor all the excesses and purges and ills of the present system.\n  But things continued on the downslide, and, finally, after much\ndeliberation, Khruschev opened the second letter.\n  All it said was: “Write two letters.”"},

This was the line that opened his novel, “Paul Clifford,”\nwritten in 1830.  The full line reveals why it is so bad:\n\n  It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents -- except\n  at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of\n  wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene\n  lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty\n  flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness."},

A few were found\ndrowned in the soup vats, and one was attacked by assailants unknown\nand beaten to death with a pot roast.

{"quote":"The most recent attempt to revive the moribund campus left, a national\nconference held at Rutgers University February 5-7, ended when the\nparticipants decided that they were too racist to found a new national\norganization.\n  The stated goal of the conference was the formation of a national\norganization that would “give expression to a shared consciousness.”  The\norientation materials declared that this was “a historic moment” -- you\nknow, like Port Huron and the Sixties -- and the Rutgers host committee had\nevery reason to expect their goal would be accomplished.\n  But it was not to be.  Given that this was a conference of *New*\nNew Leftists, reason had nothing to do with it.\n  A revealing article by Vania del Borgo and Maria Margaronis in “The\nNation”, [“Beyond the Fragments,” 3/26/88] says “The defining moment of the\nweekend came when the conference was almost at its end.  On Sunday morning,\na twenty-five-member students of color caucus confronted the assembled body\nwith its overwhelming whiteness...”  Joined by the Gay & Bisexual Caucus, the\nStudents of Color Caucus declared that the founding of such an overwhelmingly\nwhite organization would itself constitute a racist act.  The four hundred or\nso leftist activists were told that they had no right to ratify a constitution\nor elect any officers.  While recognizing “the need to examine the real\npossibilities of a broad-based, racially diverse student movement” and paying\nlip service to the need for “dialogue,” they threatened to walk out if their\ndemands were not met.  As *The Nation* article describes the scene:  “To their\nastonishment, their intervention was greeted with a standing ovation.” Handed\nan ultimatum which demanded that they disband, this would-be successor to the\nradical student movements of the Sixties promptly voted itself out of\nexistence.  As del Borgo and Margaronis put it, “After much chaotic discussion\nand a confused voice vote, the convention suspended all its other work and\nbroke into regional groups to discuss ‘outreach.’”", "author":"Libertarian Agenda, May 1988"},

It usually\nlacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel”.\n  High praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically\nrewarding stanza: It is taken from “I loved a lass” and is concerned with\nthe higher emotions.\n    She would me “Honey” call,\n    She’d -- O she’d kiss me too.\n    But now alas!  She’s left me\n    Falero, lero, loo.\n  Among other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize\nwas her prudent choice of footwear.\n    The fives did fit her shoe.\n  In 1639 the great poet’s life was endangered after his capture by\nthe Royalists during the English Civil War.  When Sir John Denham, the\nRoyalist poet, heard of Wither’s imminent execution, he went to the King and\nbegged that his life be spared.  When asked his reason, Sir John replied,\n“Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the\nworst poet in England.”", "author":"Stephen Pile, “The Book of Heroic Failures”"},

Then came the children’s lesson.\n  For this he came out of the pulpit, and sat on the communion table.\nThe congregation was mortified!  He sat there swinging his legs against\nthe table as the children gathered around him.\n  He asked the children, “What’s small, brown, furry and eats nuts?”\n  There was total silence.\n  He asked again, “What’s small, brown, furry and eats nuts?”\n  Total silence.\n  Eventually, one timid youngster put up his hand and said, “Please,\nsir, I know the answer is Jesus, but it sure sounds like a squirrel to me.”"},

The light we\nreceive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the\nSun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can compute the temperature\nof Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where\nthe heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation,\ni.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute\ntemperature of the earth (~300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact\ntemperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the\ntemperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.\nRevelations 21:8 says “But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their\npart in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.”  A lake of molten\nbrimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point,\nor 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a lake.)

Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n  Three years later the boy’s father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  “His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.”  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n  “Then you must accompany him on the piano,” said the boy’s father,\n“and it will be a sell out.”\n  Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.

A guard explained, “Yes, we were\nplanning to look for them, but never got around to it.”  The warders had\nnot, however, noticed the gaping holes in the wall because they were\n“covered with posters”.  Nor did they detect any of the spades, chisels,\nwater hoses and electric drills amassed by the inmates in large quantities.\nThe night before the breakout one guard had noticed that of the 36\nprisoners in his block only 13 were present.  He said this was “normal”\nbecause inmates sometimes missed roll-call or hid, but usually came back\nthe next morning.\n  “We only found out about the escape at 6:30 the next morning when\none of the prisoners told us,” a warder said later.

It involves a sense of future,\na belief that every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on,\nrather than out.  The trick of retiring well may be the trick of\nliving well.  It’s hard to recognize that life isn’t a holding\naction, but a process.  It’s hard to learn that we don’t leave the\nbest parts of ourselves behind, back in the dugout or the office.\nWe own what we learned back there.

Later, while\nlooking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticed\nthat “Kermit” was a Celtic word for “free”, which is what all Kermit programs\nshould be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in our\nsource code (Bill’s baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Becky\ninstead).

{"quote":"YOUR FOAMY FUTURE\n  by Miss Fortune\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)\n  You have nothing better to think about than what to wear and what\ntype of champagne to take to the neighbors Halloween Party.  Just take beer!\nDon’t try to copy the “Joneses”, pull them up to your level and remember, in\nCalifornia Hoalloween is redundant anyhow.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20)\n  Focus on strengthening friendships this Fall.  You find others are\nfascinated by your intelligence, your wit, your drinking ability, and your\nbank account.  Just make sure you realize it’s far more impressive when\nother discover your good qualities without your help."},

Don’t fret too much, Taurus.  To get back on your feet simply\nmiss two car payments.\n\nGEMINI (May 21 - June 21)\n  You think you’re falling in love with a person who has a lot in\ncommon with yourself.  You both prefer ales, you’ve both tried your hand\nat homebrewing, and you both want to visit every new brewpub that opens.\nSounds impressive but remember you really don’t know your partner until\nyou meet in court."},

Being healthy is admirable but don’t you think you’re going\nto feel stupid one day lying in a hospital dying of nothing?\n\nLEO (July 23 - August 22)\n  You will soon acquire a large sum of money and will be in seventh\nheaven as you head to the nearest Liquor Barn and buy all the beer they have\nin stock.  Whoever said money couldn’t buy happiness didn’t know where to\nshop.\n\nVIRGO (August 23 - September 22)\n  Your late night, beer drinking, “life in the fast lane” parties are\naffecting your job production the next morning.  You feel a nine to five job\nis not for a “party animal” such as yourself and may feel the need for a\ncareer change.
