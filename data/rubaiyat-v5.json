{"quote":"LXXXI.\n\n Oh Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,\n And ev’n with Paradise devise the Snake:\n   For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man\n Is blacken’d—Man’s forgiveness give—and take!"},
{"quote":"LXXXII.\n\n As under cover of departing Day\n Slunk hunger-stricken Ramazan away,\n   Once more within the Potter’s house alone\n I stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay."},
{"quote":"LXXXIII.\n\n Shapes of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small,\n That stood along the floor and by the wall;\n   And some loquacious Vessels were; and some\n Listen’d perhaps, but never talk’d at all."},
{"quote":"LXXXIV.\n\n Said one among them—“Surely not in vain\n My substance of the common Earth was ta’en\n   And to this Figure molded, to be broke,\n Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again.”"},
{"quote":"LXXXV.\n\n Then said a Second—“Ne’er a peevish Boy\n Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy;\n   And He that with his hand the Vessel made\n Will surely not in after Wrath destroy.”"},
{"quote":"LXXXVI.\n\n After a momentary silence spake\n Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make;\n   “They sneer at me for leaning all awry:\n What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?”"},
{"quote":"LXXXVII.\n\n Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot—\n I think a Sufi pipkin—waxing hot—\n   “All this of Pot and Potter—Tell me then,\n Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?”"},
{"quote":"LXXXVIII.\n\n “Why,” said another, “Some there are who tell\n Of one who threatens he will toss to Hell\n   The luckless Pots he marr’d in making—Pish!\n He’s a Good Fellow, and ’twill all be well.”"},
{"quote":"LXXXIX.\n\n “Well,” murmured one, “Let whoso make or buy,\n My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:\n   But fill me with the old familiar Juice,\n Methinks I might recover by and by.”"},
{"quote":"XC.\n\n So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,\n The little Moon look’d in that all were seeking:\n   And then they jogg’d each other, “Brother! Brother!\n Now for the Porter’s shoulders’ knot a-creaking!”"},
{"quote":"XCI.\n\n Ah, with the Grape my fading life provide,\n And wash the Body whence the Life has died,\n   And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf,\n By some not unfrequented Garden-side."},
{"quote":"XCII.\n\n That ev’n buried Ashes such a snare\n Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air\n   As not a True-believer passing by\n But shall be overtaken unaware."},
{"quote":"XCIII.\n\n Indeed the Idols I have loved so long\n Have done my credit in this World much wrong:\n   Have drown’d my Glory in a shallow Cup,\n And sold my reputation for a Song."},
{"quote":"XCIV.\n\n Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before\n I swore—but was I sober when I swore?\n   And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand\n My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore."},
{"quote":"XCV.\n\n And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,\n And robb’d me of my Robe of Honor—Well,\n   I wonder often what the Vintners buy\n One half so precious as the stuff they sell."},
{"quote":"XCVI.\n\n Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!\n That Youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!\n   The Nightingale that in the branches sang,\n Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows!"},
{"quote":"XCVII.\n\n Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield\n One glimpse—if dimly, yet indeed, reveal’d,\n   To which the fainting Traveler might spring,\n As springs the trampled herbage of the field!"},
{"quote":"XCVIII.\n\n Would but some winged Angel ere too late\n Arrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate,\n   And make the stern Recorder otherwise\n Enregister, or quite obliterate!"},
{"quote":"XCIX.\n\n Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspire\n To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,\n   Would not we shatter it to bits—and then\n Re-mold it nearer to the Heart’s Desire!"},
{"quote":"C.\n\n Yon rising Moon that looks for us again—\n How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;\n   How oft hereafter rising look for us\n Through this same Garden—and for one in vain!"},
{"quote":"CI.\n\n And when like her, oh Saki, you shall pass\n Among the Guests Star-scatter’d on the Grass,\n   And in your joyous errand reach the spot\n Where I made One—turn down an empty Glass!\nTAMAM.\n"}
